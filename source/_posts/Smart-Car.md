The goal of this competition is to build model racing car prototype which could follow the black curve on the ground detected by visual sensor. Each team is made up of three members. The other two members of our team include two third-year undergraduate student majored in automation and mathematics. An example of the route during the competition is shown here.

My task is mainly focused on the PCB design. My design is a two-layer PCB with a Freescale MCU. This is the first time I participated in an engineering project out of the normal courses. I learned the PCB design software Protel which is an old version of Altium designer.

We used a CCD camera in the heading of our car to detect the route. The real-time images were processed by the MCU and the commands were calculated by the control loop and then send to motor for speed control and servo for steer control.

Although finally we did not achieve good performance of the national competition, I really got a lot of engineering experience during this project, which also opened a small door for me to the robotic world.
