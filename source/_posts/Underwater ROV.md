This work is a part of the [OCRA](https://orcahub.org/) (Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets) project led by the [Edinburgh Centre for Robotics](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/). With the advanced experimental facility [FloWave](https://www.flowavett.co.uk/) and the underwater visual localization system [Qualisys](qualisys.com), we could conduct a lot of experiments to simulate different kinds of ocean condition in the controlled indoor environment with precise position feedback.
