## System Configuration

The basic airfram of this UAV system is a commercial EPO model called Talon.

We added many subsystems to the UAV platform to enable the autonomous targets search.

The airspeed sensor is mounted on a pretty 3D-printing sit.

The Automatic Antana Tracker(AAT) is used to extent the communication range of the 433MHz temelemtry system.
