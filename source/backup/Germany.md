This is my first time to fly out of Asia. Thank the College of Engineering of HK PolyU for providing me with this opportunity to attend this social activity. The activity is hosted by TU Berlin in the capital of Germany Berlin. As there is not direct flight from Hong Kong to Berlin, I have to transit at another city in Europe. Finally I chose to flight to Frankfurt and take trans to Berlin. I have a friend Shengyang which is study at University of Siegen not far from Frankfort. I plan to have a visit to him before heading to Berlin.
