This is the first time I arrive the South Planet.
<!-- more -->

For the first trip, I visited Gold Coast and Brisbane in Queensland, Australia. Brisbane is the third largest city in Australia with a beautiful river. The city is not large compared with Asia cities. As my wife is working in a small town called Dalby which is about 200 km to the west of Brisbane. After my flight touch down at Gold Coast airport, I got my rented car and directly drive to Dalby. I takes me about 2.5 hour to arrive there. The high speed road in Australia is quite good with speed limit of 100 km/s.

I stayed at Dalby for one night and then drive to Brisbane with Vera. Brisbane is a quite nice city for me. It is not too crowed but has all the necessary service of a medium city. After stayed at Brisbane for 2 night, we headed to Gold Coast, which is another beautiful city quite near to Brisbane. Gold Coast really has a long coast with fine sands. Vera's birthday was celebrated at a Italian restaurant. The menu was quite hard to understand for us, so we just ordered some common food such as spaghetti and pizza.

We stayed at a hostal near to the airport. Most of the roommates seems to be surfing lovers. I went back to Hong Kong the second day and Vera also went back to Dably can continue to work after a 4 days holiday.
